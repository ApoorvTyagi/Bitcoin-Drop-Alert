# Bitcoin-Drop-Alert
Inspired from Bertram Gilfoyle

## Background
In season 5 of HBO's silicon valley, Gilfoyle created this alert when the bitcoin price drops. This is the exact replica of that plus a notification for your PC with the current price.
(Beware of the Alert music);

## How it works?
Once bitcoin is below your specified value, you will recieve a notification with the current price of Bitcoin in INR along with the notification music (Turn your volume down a little bit!!). You can also change you currency to whatever you like.
